    "# Introduction : Story of transfer learning in NLP\n",
    "In early 2018, Jeremy Howard (co-founder of fast.ai) and Sebastian Ruder introduced the  [Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1801.06146.pdf) (ULMFiT) method. ULMFiT was the first **Transfer Learning** method applied to NLP. As a result, besides significantly outperforming many state-of-the-art tasks, it allowed, with only 100 labeled examples, to match performances equivalent to models trained on 100×  more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time I heard about ULMFiT was listening and following along to a [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=4) given by Jeremy Howard in a class at BYU. He demonstrated how the ``fastai`` library makes the ULMFit method significantly easier to implement for someone without much code experience. In his demo, he used an AWD-LSTM neural network pre-trained on Wikitext-103 and got state-of-the-art results. He also explained key techniques to fine-tune the models like **Discriminate Learning Rate**, **Gradual Unfreezing** and **Slanted Triangular Learning Rates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the introduction of ULMFiT, **Transfer Learning** has become very popular in NLP and even Google (BERT, Transformer-XL, XLNet), Facebook (RoBERTa, XLM) and OpenAI (GPT, GPT-2) have begun to pre-train their own models on very large corpora. This time, instead of using LSTMs, they all use a more powerful architecture based on the Transformer (cf. [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these models are powerful, ``fastai`` does not include them. Fortunately, [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) 🤗 created the well-known [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). Formerly knew as ``pytorch-transformers`` or ``pytorch-pretrained-bert``, this library brings together over 40 state-of-the-art pre-trained NLP models (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, CTRL…) implemented in PyTorch as opposed to Tensorflow, Julia, etc.. The implementation gives interesting additional utilities like pre-trained tokenizers, optimizers and configs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``transformers`` library is standalone, but incorporating it with the ``fastai`` library provides a simpler implementation compatible with powerful fastai tools like  **Discriminate Learning Rate**, **Gradual Unfreezing** or **Slanted Triangular Learning Rates**. The point here is to allow anyone — expert or non-expert — to easily achieve state-of-the-art results and to “make NLP cool again”.\n",
    "\n",
    "It worth noting that the integration of HuggingFace ``transformers`` with ``fastai`` has already been demonstrated in:\n",
    "* Keita Kurita's article [A Tutorial to Fine-Tuning BERT with Fast AI](https://mlexplained.com/2019/05/13/a-tutorial-to-fine-tuning-bert-with-fast-ai/) which makes ``pytorch_pretrained_bert`` library compatible with ``fastai``.\n",
    "* Dev Sharma's article [Using RoBERTa with Fastai for NLP](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/using-roberta-with-fastai-for-nlp-7ed3fed21f6c) which makes ``pytorch_transformers`` library compatible with ``fastai``.\n",
    "* N.B. Medium article [\"Fastai with Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, XLM, DistilBERT)\"](https://medium.com/p/fastai-with-transformers-bert-roberta-xlnet-xlm-distilbert-4f41ee18ecb2?source=email-29c8f5cf1dc4--writer.postDistributed&sk=119c3e5d748b2827af3ea863faae6376).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these articles are of high quality, not all of them are currently compatible with the last version of ``transformers``, and even the last one, which this implementation is based off of in a large part is deprecated.\n"

    "# 🛠 Integrating transformers with fastai for multiclass classification\n",
    "Before beginning the implementation, note that integrating ``transformers`` and ``fastai`` can be done in multiple different ways. For that reason, I decided to create simple solutions, that are generic and flexible. More precisely, I try to make the minimum amount of modifications in both libraries while making them compatible with the maximum amount of transformer architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in addition to this NoteBook and the [Medium article](https://medium.com/p/fastai-with-transformers-bert-roberta-xlnet-xlm-distilbert-4f41ee18ecb2?source=email-29c8f5cf1dc4--writer.postDistributed&sk=119c3e5d748b2827af3ea863faae6376), I made another version available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/IMJONEZZ/)."

Be with you in just a second PATRON: I am under subject guides, nutrition, dietetics and food science and find articles. PATRON: thank you! STUDENT: Hi! Sorry for the wait. There was someone at the desk I had to help quickly. Let me take a look STUDENT: Ok, I have the Guide page pulled up. Where and what were you trying to search? PATRON: I'm trying to find articles for my nutrition research paper PATRON: under the guide page i clicked on the the nutrition tab PATRON: and then i'm on find articles PATRON: i tried searching in the search bar my topic, but I know its not right because only one or two articles came up PATRON: So i think i have to click somewhere else to search more articles but i'm not sure where... STUDENT: Yes, you're on the right track! The subject guide page that you navigated to with the picture of of Greg Nelson is a list of good resources. Each link will take you to a database with thousands of articles. http://guides.lib.byu.edu/ndfs PATRON: gotcha PATRON: just one click away PATRON: thankyou STUDENT: You're welcome! STUDENT: Anything else I can help with? PATRON: I'm good thanks! STUDENT: Good luck! Just shoot us another chat or an email at science_reference@byu.edu if you have more questions!\n",

    "\n",
    "In this NoteBook, I explain how to combine the ``transformers`` library with the beloved ``fastai`` library. It aims to make you understand where to look and modify both libraries to make them work together. Likely, it allows you to use **Slanted Triangular Learning Rates**, **Discriminate Learning Rate** and even **Gradual Unfreezing**. As a result, without even tunning the parameters, you can obtain rapidly state-of-the-art results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, the transformers became an essential tool to NLP. Because of that, I think that pre-trained transformers architectures will be integrated soon to future versions of fastai. Meanwhile, this tutorial is a good starter.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you enjoyed this first article and found it useful. \n",
    "Thanks for reading and don't hesitate in leaving questions or suggestions.\n"
