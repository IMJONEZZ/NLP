# Write a program that translates English words to French words using word embeddings and vector space models. 
# 
# <a name="2-1"></a>
# ## 2.1 Translation as linear transformation of embeddings
# 
# Given dictionaries of English and French word embeddings you will create a transformation matrix `R`
# * Given an English word embedding, $\mathbf{e}$, you can multiply $\mathbf{eR}$ to get a new word embedding $\mathbf{f}$.
#     * Both $\mathbf{e}$ and $\mathbf{f}$ are [row vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_and_column_vectors).
# * You can then compute the nearest neighbors to `f` in the french embeddings and recommend the word that is most similar to the transformed word embedding.

# ### Describing translation as the minimization problem
# 
# Find a matrix `R` that minimizes the following equation. 
# 
# $$\arg \min _{\mathbf{R}}\| \mathbf{X R} - \mathbf{Y}\|_{F}\tag{1} $$
# 
# ### Frobenius norm
# 
# The Frobenius norm of a matrix $A$ (assuming it is of dimension $m,n$) is defined as the square root of the sum of the absolute squares of its elements:
# 
# $$\|\mathbf{A}\|_{F} \equiv \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n}\left|a_{i j}\right|^{2}}\tag{2}$$

# ### Actual loss function
# In the real world applications, the Frobenius norm loss:
# 
# $$\| \mathbf{XR} - \mathbf{Y}\|_{F}$$
# 
# is often replaced by it's squared value divided by $m$:
# 
# $$ \frac{1}{m} \|  \mathbf{X R} - \mathbf{Y} \|_{F}^{2}$$
# 
# where $m$ is the number of examples (rows in $\mathbf{X}$).
# 
# * The same R is found when using this loss function versus the original Frobenius norm.
# * The reason for taking the square is that it's easier to compute the gradient of the squared Frobenius.
# * The reason for dividing by $m$ is that we're more interested in the average loss per embedding than the  loss for the entire training set.
#     * The loss for all training set increases with more words (training examples),
#     so taking the average helps us to track the average loss regardless of the size of the training set.

# ##### [Optional] Detailed explanation why we use norm squared instead of the norm:
# <details>
# <summary>
#     Click for optional details
# </summary>
#     <p>
#         <ul>
#             <li>The norm is always nonnegative (we're summing up absolute values), and so is the square. 
#             <li> When we take the square of all non-negative (positive or zero) numbers, the order of the data is preserved.  
#             <li> For example, if 3 > 2, 3^2 > 2^2
#             <li> Using the norm or squared norm in gradient descent results in the same <i>location</i> of the minimum.
#             <li> Squaring cancels the square root in the Frobenius norm formula. Because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule"> chain rule</a>, we would have to do more calculations if we had a square root in our expression for summation.
#             <li> Dividing the function value by the positive number doesn't change the optimum of the function, for the same reason as described above.
#             <li> We're interested in transforming English embedding into the French. Thus, it is more important to measure average loss per embedding than the loss for the entire dictionary (which increases as the number of words in the dictionary increases).
#         </ul>

# ### Exercise 02: Implementing translation mechanism described in this section.
# 
# #### Step 1: Computing the loss
# * The loss function will be squared Frobenoius norm of the difference between
# matrix and its approximation, divided by the number of training examples $m$.
# * Its formula is:
# $$ L(X, Y, R)=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n}\left( a_{i j} \right)^{2}$$
# 
# where $a_{i j}$ is value in $i$th row and $j$th column of the matrix $\mathbf{XR}-\mathbf{Y}$.

# #### Instructions: complete the `compute_loss()` function
# 
# * Compute the approximation of `Y` by matrix multiplying `X` and `R`
# * Compute difference `XR - Y`
# * Compute the squared Frobenius norm of the difference and divide it by $m$.

# ### Step 3: Finding the optimal R with gradient descent algorithm
# 
# #### Gradient descent
# 
# [Gradient descent](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.html) is an iterative algorithm which is used in searching for the optimum of the function. 
# * Earlier, we've mentioned that the gradient of the loss with respect to the matrix encodes how much a tiny change in some coordinate of that matrix affect the change of loss function.
# * Gradient descent uses that information to iteratively change matrix `R` until we reach a point where the loss is minimized. 

# #### Training with a fixed number of iterations
# 
# Most of the time we iterate for a fixed number of training steps rather than iterating until the loss falls below a threshold.
# 
# ##### OPTIONAL: explanation for fixed number of iterations

# <p>
# <ul>
#     <li> You cannot rely on training loss getting low -- what you really want is the validation loss to go down, or validation accuracy to go up. And indeed - in some cases people train until validation accuracy reaches a threshold, or -- commonly known as "early stopping" -- until the validation accuracy starts to go down, which is a sign of over-fitting.
#     </li>
#     <li>
#     Why not always do "early stopping"? Well, mostly because well-regularized models on larger data-sets never stop improving. Especially in NLP, you can often continue training for months and the model will continue getting slightly and slightly better. This is also the reason why it's hard to just stop at a threshold -- unless there's an external customer setting the threshold, why stop, where do you put the threshold?
#     </li>
#     <li>Stopping after a certain number of steps has the advantage that you know how long your training will take - so you can keep some sanity and not train for months. You can then try to get the best performance within this time budget. Another advantage is that you can fix your learning rate schedule -- e.g., lower the learning rate at 10% before finish, and then again more at 1% before finishing. Such learning rate schedules help a lot, but are harder to do if you don't know how long you're training.
#     </li>
# </ul>
# </p>

# Pseudocode:
# 1. Calculate gradient $g$ of the loss with respect to the matrix $R$.
# 2. Update $R$ with the formula:
# $$R_{\text{new}}= R_{\text{old}}-\alpha g$$
# 
# Where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, which is a scalar.

# #### Learning rate
# 
# * The learning rate or "step size" $\alpha$ is a coefficient which decides how much we want to change $R$ in each step.
# * If we change $R$ too much, we could skip the optimum by taking too large of a step.
# * If we make only small changes to $R$, we will need many steps to reach the optimum.
# * Learning rate $\alpha$ is used to control those changes.
# * Values of $\alpha$ are chosen depending on the problem, and we'll use `learning_rate`$=0.0003$ as the default value for our algorithm.

# ## 2.2 Testing the translation
# 
# ### k-Nearest neighbors algorithm
# 
# [k-Nearest neighbors algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) 
# * k-NN is a method which takes a vector as input and finds the other vectors in the dataset that are closest to it. 
# * The 'k' is the number of "nearest neighbors" to find (e.g. k=2 finds the closest two neighbors).
# 
# ### Searching for the translation embedding
# Since we're approximating the translation function from English to French embeddings by a linear transformation matrix $\mathbf{R}$, most of the time we won't get the exact embedding of a French word when we transform embedding $\mathbf{e}$ of some particular English word into the French embedding space. 
# * This is where $k$-NN becomes really useful! By using $1$-NN with $\mathbf{eR}$ as input, we can search for an embedding $\mathbf{f}$ (as a row) in the matrix $\mathbf{Y}$ which is the closest to the transformed vector $\mathbf{eR}$

# ### Cosine similarity
# Cosine similarity between vectors $u$ and $v$ calculated as the cosine of the angle between them.
# The formula is 
# 
# $$\cos(u,v)=\frac{u\cdot v}{\left\|u\right\|\left\|v\right\|}$$
# 
# * $\cos(u,v)$ = $1$ when $u$ and $v$ lie on the same line and have the same direction.
# * $\cos(u,v)$ is $-1$ when they have exactly opposite directions.
# * $\cos(u,v)$ is $0$ when the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other.

# #### Note: Distance and similarity are pretty much opposite things.
# * We can obtain distance metric from cosine similarity, but the cosine similarity can't be used directly as the distance metric. 
# * When the cosine similarity increases (towards $1$), the "distance" between the two vectors decreases (towards $0$). 
# * We can define the cosine distance between $u$ and $v$ as
# $$d_{\text{cos}}(u,v)=1-\cos(u,v)$$

# <a name="ex-05"></a>
# 
# **Exercise 05**: Complete the function `nearest_neighbor()`
# 
# Inputs:
# * Vector `v`,
# * A set of possible nearest neighbors `candidates`
# * `k` nearest neighbors to find.
# * The distance metric should be based on cosine similarity.
# * `cosine_similarity` function is already implemented and imported for you. It's arguments are two vectors and it returns the cosine of the angle between them.
# * Iterate over rows in `candidates`, and save the result of similarities between current row and vector `v` in a python list. Take care that similarities are in the same order as row vectors of `candidates`.
# * Now you can use [numpy argsort]( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.argsort.html#numpy.argsort) to sort the indices for the rows of `candidates`.

# 
# # 3. LSH and document search
# 
# In this part of the assignment, you will implement a more efficient version
# of k-nearest neighbors using locality sensitive hashing.
# You will then apply this to document search.
# 
# * Process the tweets and represent each tweet as a vector (represent a
# document with a vector embedding).
# * Use locality sensitive hashing and k nearest neighbors to find tweets
# that are similar to a given tweet.

# In[40]:


# get the positive and negative tweets

# 
# ### 3.1 Getting the document embeddings
# 
# #### Bag-of-words (BOW) document models
# Text documents are sequences of words.
# * The ordering of words makes a difference. For example, sentences "Apple pie is
# better than pepperoni pizza." and "Pepperoni pizza is better than apple pie"
# have opposite meanings due to the word ordering.
# * However, for some applications, ignoring the order of words can allow
# us to train an efficient and still effective model.
# * This approach is called Bag-of-words document model.
# 
# #### Document embeddings
# * Document embedding is created by summing up the embeddings of all words
# in the document.
# * If we don't know the embedding of some word, we can ignore that word.

# <a name="ex-07"></a>
# 
# **Exercise 07**:
# Complete the `get_document_embedding()` function.
# * The function `get_document_embedding()` encodes entire document as a "document" embedding.
# * It takes in a docoument (as a string) and a dictionary, `en_embeddings`
# * It processes the document, and looks up the corresponding embedding of each word.
# * It then sums them up and returns the sum of all word vectors of that processed tweet.

# ## 3.3 Finding the most similar tweets with LSH

#

# <div style="width:image width px; font-size:100%; text-align:center;"><img src='one.png' alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="width:400px;height:200px;" /> Figure 3 </div>
# 
# You can divide the vector space into regions and search within one region for nearest neighbors of a given vector.
#

N_DIMS = len(ind2Tweet[1])     # Vector dimensionality.
print(f"Number of vectors is {N_VECS} and each has {N_DIMS} dimensions.")


# #### Choosing the number of planes
# 
# * Each plane divides the space to $2$ parts.
# * So $n$ planes divide the space into $2^{n}$ hash buckets.
# * We want to organize 10,000 document vectors into buckets so that every bucket has about $~16$ vectors.
# * For that we need $\frac{10000}{16}=625$ buckets.
# * We're interested in $n$, number of planes, so that $2^{n}= 625$. Now, we can calculate $n=\log_{2}625 = 9.29 \approx 10$.

# In[49]:


# The number of planes. We use log2(625) to have ~16 vectors/bucket.
N_PLANES = 10
# Number of times to repeat the hashing to improve the search.
N_UNIVERSES = 25


# <a name="3-4"></a>
# 
# ## 3.4 Getting the hash number for a vector
# 
# For each vector, we need to get a unique number associated to that vector in order to assign it to a "hash bucket".
# 
# ### Hyperplanes in vector spaces
# * In $3$-dimensional vector space, the hyperplane is a regular plane. In $2$ dimensional vector space, the hyperplane is a line.
# * Generally, the hyperplane is subspace which has dimension $1$ lower than the original vector space has.
# * A hyperplane is uniquely defined by its normal vector.
# * Normal vector $n$ of the plane $\pi$ is the vector to which all vectors in the plane $\pi$ are orthogonal (perpendicular in $3$ dimensional case).
# 
# ### Using Hyperplanes to split the vector space
# We can use a hyperplane to split the vector space into $2$ parts.
# * All vectors whose dot product with a plane's normal vector is positive are on one side of the plane.
# * All vectors whose dot product with the plane's normal vector is negative are on the other side of the plane.
# 
# ### Encoding hash buckets
# * For a vector, we can take its dot product with all the planes, then encode this information to assign the vector to a single hash bucket.
# * When the vector is pointing to the opposite side of the hyperplane than normal, encode it by 0.
# * Otherwise, if the vector is on the same side as the normal vector, encode it by 1.
# * If you calculate the dot product with each plane in the same order for every vector, you've encoded each vector's unique hash ID as a binary number, like [0, 1, 1, ... 0].

# <a name="ex-09"></a>
# 
# ### Exercise 09: Implementing hash buckets
# 
# We've initialized hash table `hashes` for you. It is list of `N_UNIVERSES` matrices, each describes its own hash table. Each matrix has `N_DIMS` rows and `N_PLANES` columns. Every column of that matrix is a `N_DIMS`-dimensional normal vector for each of `N_PLANES` hyperplanes which are used for creating buckets of the particular hash table.
# 
# *Exercise*: Your task is to complete the function `hash_value_of_vector` which places vector `v` in the correct hash bucket.
# 
# * First multiply your vector `v`, with a corresponding plane. This will give you a vector of dimension $(1,\text{N_planes})$.
# * You will then convert every element in that vector to 0 or 1.
# * You create a hash vector by doing the following: if the element is negative, it becomes a 0, otherwise you change it to a 1.
# * You then compute the unique number for the vector by iterating over `N_PLANES`
# * Then you multiply $2^i$ times the corresponding bit (0 or 1).
# * You will then store that sum in the variable `hash_value`.
# 
# **Intructions:** Create a hash for the vector in the function below.
# Use this formula:
# 
# $$ hash = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \left( 2^{i} \times h_{i} \right) $$

# #### Create the sets of planes
# * Create multiple (25) sets of planes (the planes that divide up the region).
# * You can think of these as 25 separate ways of dividing up the vector space with a different set of planes.
# * Each element of this list contains a matrix with 300 rows (the word vector have 300 dimensions), and 10 columns (there are 10 planes in each "universe").

# 
# ### Exercise 10
# 
# Given that you have a unique number for each vector (or tweet), You now want to create a hash table. You need a hash table, so that given a hash_id, you can quickly look up the corresponding vectors. This allows you to reduce your search by a significant amount of time.
# 
# <div style="width:image width px; font-size:100%; text-align:center;"><img src='table.png' alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="width:500px;height:200px;" />  </div>
# 
# We have given you the `make_hash_table` function, which maps the tweet vectors to a bucket and stores the vector there. It returns the `hash_table` and the `id_table`. The `id_table` allows you know which vector in a certain bucket corresponds to what tweet.

# ### 3.6 Creating all hash tables
# 
# You can now hash your vectors and store them in a hash table that
# would allow you to quickly look up and search for similar vectors.
# Run the cell below to create the hashes. By doing so, you end up having
# several tables which have all the vectors. Given a vector, you then
# identify the buckets in all the tables.  You can then iterate over the
# buckets and consider much fewer vectors. The more buckets you use, the
# more accurate your lookup will be, but also the longer it will take.

# ### Approximate K-NN
# 
# <a name="ex-11"></a>
# 
# ### Exercise 11
# 
# Implement approximate K nearest neighbors using locality sensitive hashing,
# to search for documents that are similar to a given document at the
# index `doc_id`.
# 
# ##### Inputs
# * `doc_id` is the index into the document list `all_tweets`.
# * `v` is the document vector for the tweet in `all_tweets` at index `doc_id`.
# * `planes_l` is the list of planes (the global variable created earlier).
# * `k` is the number of nearest neighbors to search for.
# * `num_universes_to_use`: to save time, we can use fewer than the total
# number of available universes.  By default, it's set to `N_UNIVERSES`,
# which is $25$ for this assignment.
# 
# The `approximate_knn` function finds a subset of candidate vectors that
# are in the same "hash bucket" as the input vector 'v'.  Then it performs
# the usual k-nearest neighbors search on this subset (instead of searching
# through all 10,000 tweets).
