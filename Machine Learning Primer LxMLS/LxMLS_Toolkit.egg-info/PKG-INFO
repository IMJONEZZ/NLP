# LxMLS 2019

Machine learning toolkit for natural language processing. Written for Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School (lxmls.it.pt). This covers

* Scientific Python and Mathematical background
* Linear Classifiers
* Sequence Models
* Structured Prediction
* Syntax and Parsing
* Feed-forward models in deep learning
* Sequence models in deep learning
* Reinforcement Learning

Machine learning toolkit for natural language processing. Written for [LxMLS - Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School](http://lxmls.it.pt/)

## Get the lxmls code-base

If you are not familiar with `Git`, just download the zip available in the `Clone or Download` button. **Important**: Use the student version. It should be the one in the page displaying this README. Then unzip and enter the main folder. This will be your working folder

    cd lxmls-toolkit-student

If you feel comfortable with `Git` you may instead clone the repo and checkout the student branch

    git clone https://github.com/LxMLS/lxmls-toolkit.git
    cd lxmls-toolkit/
    git checkout student

## Install modules with Anaconda or pip

If you are new to Python, the simplest method is to use `Anaconda`to handle your packages, just go to

    https://www.anaconda.com/download/

and follow the instructions. We strongly recommend using at least Python 3.

If you prefer `pip` to Anaconda you can install the toolkit in a way that does
not interfere with your existing installation. For this you can use a virtual
environment as follows 

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install pip setuptools --upgrade
    pip install --editable . 

This will install the toolkit in a way that is modifiable. If you want to also
virtualize you Python version (e.g. you are stuck with Python2 on your system),
have a look at `pyenv`.

Bear in mind that the main purpose of the toolkit is educative. You may resort
to other toolboxes if you are looking for efficient implementations of the
algorithms described.


## Solving Exercises

Some day will require you to complete code from previous days. If you have not completed the exercises you can allways use the `solve.py` command as for example

    python solve.py sequence_models

**Important**: This will delete your code on the correspondig file!. Save it before. To undo solving (this wont return your code) do

    python solve.py --undo sequence_models
