# Estimated Time: 20 minutes

# # Candidates from String Edits
# Create a list of candidate strings by applying an edit operation
# <br>
# ### Imports and Data

# In[1]:


# data
word = 'dearz' # ðŸ¦Œ


# ### Splits
# Find all the ways you can split a word into 2 parts !

# In[2]:


# splits with a loop
splits_a = []
for i in range(len(word)+1):
    splits_a.append([word[:i],word[i:]])

for i in splits_a:
    print(i)


# In[3]:


# same splits, done using a list comprehension
splits_b = [(word[:i], word[i:]) for i in range(len(word) + 1)]

for i in splits_b:
    print(i)


# ### Delete Edit
# Delete a letter from each string in the `splits` list.
# <br>
# What this does is effectivly delete each possible letter from the original word being edited. 

# In[4]:


# deletes with a loop
splits = splits_a
deletes = []

print('word : ', word)
for L,R in splits:
    if R:
        print(L + R[1:], ' <-- delete ', R[0])


# It's worth taking a closer look at how this is excecuting a 'delete'.
# <br>
# Taking the first item from the `splits` list :

# In[5]:


# breaking it down
print('word : ', word)
one_split = splits[0]
print('first item from the splits list : ', one_split)
L = one_split[0]
R = one_split[1]
print('L : ', L)
print('R : ', R)
print('*** now implicit delete by excluding the leading letter ***')
print('L + R[1:] : ',L + R[1:], ' <-- delete ', R[0])


# So the end result transforms **'dearz'** to **'earz'** by deleting the first character.
# <br>
# And you use a **loop** (code block above) or a **list comprehension** (code block below) to do
# <br>
# this for the entire `splits` list.

# In[6]:


# deletes with a list comprehension
splits = splits_a
deletes = [L + R[1:] for L, R in splits if R]

print(deletes)
print('*** which is the same as ***')
for i in deletes:
    print(i)


# ### Ungraded Exercise
# You now have a list of ***candidate strings*** created after performing a **delete** edit.
# <br>
# Next step will be to filter this list for ***candidate words*** found in a vocabulary.
# <br>
# Given the example vocab below, can you think of a way to create a list of candidate words ? 
# <br>
# Remember, you already have a list of candidate strings, some of which are certainly not actual words you might find in your vocabulary !
# <br>
# <br>
# So from the above list **earz, darz, derz, deaz, dear**. 
# <br>
# You're really only interested in **dear**.

# In[12]:


vocab = ['dean','deer','dear','fries','and','coke']
edits = list(deletes)

print('vocab : ', vocab)
print('edits : ', edits)

candidates=[]

### START CODE HERE ###
candidates = set([word for word in vocab if word in edits])  # hint: 'set.intersection'
### END CODE HERE ###

print('candidate words : ', candidates)


# Expected Outcome:
# 
# vocab :  ['dean', 'deer', 'dear', 'fries', 'and', 'coke']
# <br>
# edits :  ['earz', 'darz', 'derz', 'deaz', 'dear']
# <br>
# candidate words :  {'dear'}

# ### Summary
# You've unpacked an integral part of the assignment by breaking down **splits** and **edits**, specifically looking at **deletes** here.
# <br>
# Implementation of the other edit types (insert, replace, switch) follows a similar methodology and should now feel somewhat familiar when you see them.
# <br>
# This bit of the code isn't as intuitive as other sections, so well done!
# <br>
# You should now feel confident facing some of the more technical parts of the assignment at the end of the week.
